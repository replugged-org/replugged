# Is this against the ToS?
Long story short... __yes__. Replugged is against the Discord Terms of Service â€” but, you should keep reading:  

As of right now, __Discord is not going out of their way to detect client mods or ban client mod users__. On top of that, Replugged does not make any manual HTTP requests unlike certain client mods / plugins, so your client's user agent is the same as a legitimate client. Meaning, Discord doesn't detect a client mod like Replugged. They can go out of their way to start detecting it, but they don't.  

Hypothetically speaking - even if they somehow did detect Replugged, users are very unlikely to be banned on sight. It doesn't make sense for Discord to start banning a substantial part of it's userbase (client mod users) without any kind of warning. Not to mention it is mandatory for Replugged plugins to be fully API-compliant and ethical, implying Replugged users can't be banned for indirect ToS violations (e.g. selfbotting).
