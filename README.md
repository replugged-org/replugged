## Installation
See the [installation page of the Replugged website](https://replugged.dev/installation).

[![Replugged Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/1000926524452647132/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/replugged)

If the plugin/theme you want isn't in the Replugged server, check out the old archived [Powercord server](https://discord.gg/powercord). Note that some of the plugins may be outdated or abandoned. 

#### How to install plugins/themes
Join our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/replugged) and read the pinned messages. Or go to the GitHub repository of the plugin or theme you want to install, where they might have installation instructions. Most likely they'll have a link that installs the plugin/theme automatically. The plugin and theme channels in the Discord server also have install buttons which you can conveniently click!

## Is this against the ToS?
Long story short... __yes__. Replugged is against the Discord Terms of Service â€” but, you should keep reading:  

As of right now, __Discord is not going out of their way to detect client mods or ban client mod users__. On top of that, Replugged does not make any manual HTTP requests unlike certain client mods / plugins, so your client's user agent is the same as a legitimate client. Meaning, Discord doesn't detect a client mod like Replugged. They can go out of their way to start detecting it, but they don't.  

Hypothetically speaking - even if they somehow did detect Replugged, users are very unlikely to be banned on sight. It doesn't make sense for Discord to start banning a substantial part of it's userbase (client mod users) without any kind of warning. Not to mention it is mandatory for Replugged plugins to be fully API-compliant and ethical, implying Replugged users can't be banned for indirect ToS violations (e.g. selfbotting).
